                <p>One of the biggest challenges in software development is time. It’s something we can’t easily get more of, but linting can help us make the most out of the time we have.</p>

                </div>
                <p>When code is not describable using words, most people have to do some mental mapping to turn it in to words. This wastes mental energy, and you run the risk of getting the mapping wrong. Different people will map to different words, which
                    leads to confusion when discussing the code.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Node.js treats each JavaScript file as a separate module. For instance, if you have a file containing some code and this file is named xyz.js, then this file is treated as a module in Node, and you can say that you’ve created a module
                    named xyz.</p>
